# 49. Group Anagrams
For this problem my first intuition was just comparing each input to all others, check if they are anagrams and if they are take them out of the input list and group them. 
However, I felt it must be possible in a faster way as this approach would be quite inefficient; so my next idea was to get some hash key of some sort for each word that would be identical for anagramas but different for every other word. The solution here was to use the sorted word as the key, which can be done in python using `sorted()`. To make comparisons easy, I also decided to cast this sorted list to a string. This string is then used as a key in a dictionary which maps `str -> List[str]`. For the final return value we can then just return a list of the value set of the dictionary.
